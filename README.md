Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
this is developing, testing and maintaining software in a computer. Every thing nowadays is leaning on to technology and as such software engineering is a necessity in our daily lives.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Better and faster computers
Easy access of information.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Identify the problem and how to solve it.
Developemnt - Making the idea into results.
Testing - Ensuring everything runs as it should be.
Deployment - Sharing it to the public to access.
Maintainance - You need to do check ups here and there to ensure everything runs smoothly.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The software Developer is the person that makes the idea into something visual including the design, we can call them the creator. The Quality Assurance is there to make sure that what was initially conceptualized is what has been devloped by the Developer. The project Manager on the other end ensures that everything is running smoothly. He is the overall supervisor on the projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is chatting with a bot. They have frequently asked questions and solutions so they run automatically without requiring any human output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
